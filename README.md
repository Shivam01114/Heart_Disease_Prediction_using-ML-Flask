AI-Powered Heart Disease Prediction & Explainable Clinical Decision System

🩺 Overview

This project is an AI-driven heart disease prediction system that not only predicts the presence of heart disease but also explains the prediction in a doctor-like manner using clinical reasoning.
The system uses a Logistic Regression machine learning model trained on clinical heart data and presents results through an interactive medical dashboard with visual analytics, parameter-wise summaries, and an AI Doctor voice explanation (English & Hindi).
This project focuses on Explainable AI (XAI), clinical interpretability, and user-friendly healthcare decision support.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 Machine Learning
Logistic Regression model trained on heart disease dataset
